Sending package 1: 1_3816,Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer

Sending package 7: 7_3875,That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Sending package 8: 8_3516,Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
Sending package 9: 9_4089,To sleep, perchance to dreamâ€”ay, there's the rub:

say we end
Sending package 3: 306_4377,The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
Sending package 3: 307_3875,That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Sending package 3: 308_3516,Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
Sending package 3: 309_4089,To sleep, perchance to dreamâ€”ay, there's the rub:
Sending package 3: 310_4372,For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
Sending package 3: 311_4002,When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Sending package 3: 312_3299,Must give us pauseâ€”there's the respect
Sending package 3: 313_3317,That makes calamity of so long life.
Sending package 3: 314_4427,For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Sending package 3: 315_4538,Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
Sending package 3: 316_4037,The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
Sending package 3: 317_3639,The insolence of office, and the spurns
Sending package 3: 318_3837,That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
Sending package 3: 319_3612,When he himself might his quietus make
Sending package 3: 320_3895,With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
Sending package 3: 321_3495,To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
Sending package 3: 322_4078,But that the dread of something after death,
Sending package 3: 323_4157,The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
Sending package 3: 324_3769,No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
Sending package 3: 325_3981,And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Sending package 3: 326_3593,Than fly to others that we know not of?
Sending package 3: 327_4106,Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all,
Sending package 3: 328_3540,And thus the native hue of resolution
Sending package 3: 329_4297,Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
Sending package 3: 330_3825,And enterprises of great pith and moment
Sending package 3: 331_4017,With this regard their currents turn awry
Sending package 3: 332_2515,And lose the name of action.
Sending package 3: 333_3688,To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Sending package 3: 334_3816,Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
Sending package 3: 335_4254,The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Sending package 3: 336_3788,Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
Sending package 3: 337_3437,And by opposing end them. To dieâ€”to sleep,
Sending package 3: 338_3232,No more; and by a sleep to say we end
